## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Blueprint Blue (#4682B4) to evoke the technical drawings and engineering schematics, adding depth to the app.
- Background color: Light gray (#E0E0E0) to offer a neutral backdrop that simulates the look of technical papers while ensuring content stands out.
- Accent color: Rust Red (#A0522D) to add a touch of mechanical warmth, acting as a visual cue for interactive elements or notifications.
- Body and headline font: 'Roboto Mono' (monospace) for a technical, precise feel.
- Use SVGs and gear icons to create a mechanical theme.
- Incorporate mechanical animations for page transitions and interactive elements (e.g., gears turning).  Incorporate Lottie animations for progress bar gear fill.
- Create a responsive UI for desktop, tablet, and mobile. Use modular components for subject cards, GPA meters, etc.
